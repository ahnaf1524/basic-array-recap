# Final Recap by Fraz DSA Algo Course

### âœ… **Foundational Array Problems (No DSA Required)**

#### í¿¢ Basic Input, Output, and Traversal
1. **Print all elements of an array**
2. **Print all elements in reverse order**
3. **Take N elements from user and print only even numbers**
4. **Count total number of positive, negative, and zero elements**
5. **Print elements at even and odd indices separately**

---

#### â• Summation & Averaging
6. **Find the sum of all elements**
7. **Find the average of array elements**
8. **Find the sum of only even or odd numbers**
9. **Find the difference between sum of even and odd numbers**

---

#### í´ Simple Search & Compare
10. **Find the largest element in the array**
11. **Find the smallest element**
12. **Find second largest number (without sorting)**
13. **Search if a specific value exists (Linear Search)**

---

#### í´ Reversing & Swapping
14. **Reverse an array manually (without using built-in functions)**
15. **Swap first and last elements of an array**
16. **Swap adjacent elements in an array**

---

#### í³Š Counting & Conditions
17. **Count how many times a number appears in the array**
18. **Print all elements greater than a given number X**
19. **Print all elements smaller than the average**
20. **Count numbers divisible by 3 or 5**

---

#### í·  Logic-Based Patterns
21. **Check if all elements are the same**
22. **Check if array is strictly increasing or decreasing**
23. **Check if an array is a palindrome**
24. **Count how many elements are greater than their neighbors**
25. **Count how many elements are prime numbers**

---

Would you like these as a practice sheet (PDF or Markdown)? Or with sample inputs and outputs so you can try them yourself?Here's a list of **super beginner-friendly array problems** that focus purely on **logic-building** and **basic programming** skills â€” no DSA knowledge required. These are great for forming a strong foundation before jumping into algorithms or complex data structures.
